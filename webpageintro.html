        <h2> Introduction to webdesign </h2>
            <p> Web design is the visual aesthetics and page layout of a website. It goes hand-in-hand with web development in the creation of a static website or dynamic web application.
<br> 
Even if you don’t consider yourself a creative person, it’s still a good idea to learn web design. No matter whether you want to make static websites or dynamic web applications, design is an important part of the process. The design is the first thing people notice when they arrive on a website, and if it’s not good enough, they’ll leave. You don’t want to create a site that frustrates people, do you?<br>

If you do identify yourself as a creative person, you might even consider a career as a web designer. Today, there is a huge need for competent web designers with up-to-date skills. It’s not an opportunity to be sneezed at.<br>

Learn coding and you’ll be a valuable asset to many. But learn coding and design and you’ll be second to none! </p>

            <h3>Web Design Overview</h3>
            
            <p> The web design process starts with a visual concept, which you could sketch by hand or with software like Photoshop. Then, you use HTML and CSS to build the website. HTML and CSS are the codes for writing web pages. HTML handles the basic structure and ‘bones’ of your page, while CSS handles the style and appearance.
            
            <br>
                Responsive design is a popular technique for making websites look good and function well on additional devices, like phones and tablets. It does this by setting different CSS rules for different browser widths.
